# findingSeaAnimals
Level 1: The game presents randomly “floating” different sea animals hidden between other objects and animals. There is a little device available (e.g. a net) which can be moved using the keyboard and/or mouse. The aim of the player is to collect sea animal symbols and not the others. Each correct symbol collected will add points, each incorrect symbol collected would deduct points. Level 2: The player should be able to see different random symbols for each new game. Also, sea animal symbols change into something else at certain times or become invisible for a short period of time.
